      <description>prematurely published draftThe following problem is from a high-school-level physics puzzle book Gn√§dig, Honyek, and Riley (2001) (Problem #9):
The suspension springs of all four wheels of a car are identical. By how much does the body of the car (considered rigid) rise above each of the wheels when its right front wheel is parked on an 8-cm-high pavement? Does the result change when the car is parked with both right wheels on the pavement?</description>
