      <description>As the pilot of my new blog site, I would like to touch on Bayesian decision theory, which can be found in many statistical inference textbooks, such as Shao (2003).
Decision TheoryUnder the framework of decision theory, we define \(X \in \mathcal{X}\) as observed random variables (or data), \(\theta \in \Theta\) as state of nature (or parameter of the data generator), and \(a \in \mathcal{A}\) as action to be taken.</description>
