<p><em>In this blog post, I studied a generalized version of the car suspension problem, and discovered an elegant result.</em></p>
<div id="original-problem" class="section level1">
<h1>Original Problem</h1>
<p>The original car suspension problem is from a high school physics puzzle book <span class="citation">Gnädig, Honyek, and Riley (2001)</span> (Problem #9):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The suspension springs of all four wheels of a car are identical. By how much does the body of the car (considered rigid) rise above each of the wheels when its right front wheel is parked on an 8-cm-high pavement? Does the result change when the car is parked with both right wheels on the pavement? Does the result depend on the number and positions of the people sitting in the car?</p>

<p>The original problem statement is not very rigorous, which I believe is because the authors wanted to encourage students to refine and abstract real life problems instead of simply tackling exercises. Based on my understanding of the physical process, I set up an idealized model as “a rectangle table with spring legs” (<em>Figure 2</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>The body of the car is modeled by a thin rectangular plate with certain mass distribution (mass center <span class="math inline">\(\neq\)</span> geometric center), and it is level (normal direction pointing upwards) before perturbation.</li>
<li>Each wheel-suspension is modeled by a linear spring (zero mass, obeying Hooke’s law with stiffness <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>) vertically attached to one corner of the car.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
<li>The 8-cm-high perturbation is small compared to the compressions of the springs (<span class="math inline">\(h \ll Mg / k\)</span>, or, the springs are flexible enough), such that the wheels always stay in contact with the ground.</li>
<li>The 8-cm-high perturbation is small compared to the scale of the car (<span class="math inline">\(h \ll D\)</span>), such that the body of the car remains approximately level after perturbation.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<h1>Generalized Problem and Solution</h1>
<p>A generalized version of the car suspension problem is to consider <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> springs distributed in possibly asymmetric ways.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<ul>
<li>For the right-front perturbation case, the right front and left back springs are each further compressed by 2cm, while the other two springs are relatively stretched by 2cm. This causes the corners of the body raised by 6cm (right front), -2cm (left back), and 2cm (left front and right back).</li>
<li>For the both-right perturbation case, the compressions of four springs do not change.</li>
<li>The results do not depend on the car’s mass distribution.</li>
</ul>
