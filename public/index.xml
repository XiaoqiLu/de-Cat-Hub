      <description>The following problem is from a high-school-level physics puzzle book Gn√§dig, Honyek, and Riley (2001) (P9):
The suspension springs of all four wheels of a car are identical. By how much does the body of the car (considered rigid) rise above each of the wheels when its right front wheel is parked on an 8-cm-high pavement? Does the result change when the car is parked with both right wheels on the pavement?</description>

      <description>As the pilot of my new blog site, I would like to touch on Bayesian decision theory, which can be found in many statistical inference textbooks, such as Shao (2003).
Decision TheoryUnder the framework of decision theory, we define \(X \in \mathcal{X}\) as observed random variables (or data), \(\theta \in \Theta\) as state of nature (or parameter of the data generator), and \(a \in \mathcal{A}\) as action to be taken.</description>
