      <description>In this blog post, I studied a generalized version of the car suspension problem, and discovered an elegant result.
Original ProblemThe original car suspension problem is from a high school physics puzzle book Gn√§dig, Honyek, and Riley (2001) (Problem #9):
The suspension springs of all four wheels of a car are identical. By how much does the body of the car (considered rigid) rise above each of the wheels when its right front wheel is parked on an 8-cm-high pavement?</description>
